"""
What is an iterable, iterator, and a generator? Oh My!
Q: Is a List an iterator?
A: It is iterable, but it is NOT an iterator.
Q: So what does it mean that something is 'iterable?'
A: Something that is iterable is something that can be 'looped' over. These include strings, lists, dictionaries,
tuples, files, generators, etc. The object needs to be able to return an interator object from its dunder __iter__
method. The iterator object returned must define a __next__ method. 
Q: How do we know that something is iterable?
A: It needs to have dunder (magic) method __iter__
A: When you are using a for loop over an object, you are calling its __iter__ method.
Q: So what is an iterator?
A: An iterator is an object with a state so that it remembers where it is during iteration.
Q: How does an iterator get its next value?
A: An iterator gets its next value though the __next__ method
A: One of the reasons a list is not an iterator is that it does not have a __next__ method.
Q: What's the difference between a function and a generator?
A: A generator yields values whereas a function returns values. A generator also maintains state.
